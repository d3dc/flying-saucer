> The ðŸ‘¾ aren't in the bikeshed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A zero-config extension to `create-react-app` for scalable single-page apps with functional react.

**features:**

- ðŸ”— Compose feature modules as declarative React components
- ðŸ”© Opinionated syntax from [babel-preset-techno-babel](https://github.com/d3dc/babel-preset-techno-babel) with a focus on composability
- ðŸ“¬ [Models](https://rematch.gitbooks.io/rematch/docs/api.html#models) provide a bite-size abstraction for redux and keep rendering fast with first-class [selectors](https://rematch.gitbooks.io/rematch/plugins/select/)
- ðŸ§± Write business logic and data sources as plain modules and let dependency injection handle the rest

- ðŸ”‹ Batteries included!

## Whats in the Box?

### One-touch bootstrap or migrate

- run the latest `create-react-app` and add `react-flying-saucer`

```

- add `react-flying-saucer` to an existing app bootstrapped with `create-react-app`

```sh
$ cd <project>
$ npx migrate-react-flying-saucer
```

### import aliases

> One flying saucer, Two flying saucers

`@`

A link to the source root of your project.

`@@`

[re-exports](#exported-utilities) everything you need for creating and mounting a feature fleet.

```js

```

### dot files

`react-flying-saucer` respects any `.babelrc` and `.eslintrc` configuration files. Any additional configuration your project needs can be added directly to these files.
