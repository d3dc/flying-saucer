# Standalone Mothership

If you are using another build tool such as Next or Gatsby, you can still use all of the features of `react-flying-saucer`.

`react-mothership` can be installed and used the same as the `@@` alias.

`babel-preset-techno-babel` can be used to get the same babel syntax and must be configured with your build tool.

The package `react-mothership` currently requires the babel preset `babel-preset-techno-babel` to be installed and configured with the build tool. This may change in stable releases.
